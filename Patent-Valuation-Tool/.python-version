### Step 2: Upload Files Directly to GitHub

1.  **Go to your repository on GitHub** in your web browser.
2.  Click the **"Add file"** button $\rightarrow$ **"Upload files."**
3.  Upload the following two files from your project root:
    * **`.python-version`** (The new file)
    * **`requirements.txt`** (This file was previously missing from the remote server, causing the build error.)
4.  Commit the changes directly to the `main` branch.

### Step 3: Trigger Manual Deployment on Render

Uploading the files to GitHub will automatically trigger a new deployment on Render.

1.  Go back to your **Render Dashboard**.
2.  Go to the **Deploys** tab for your Web Service.
3.  Watch the build log.

**If the build succeeds,** you will be ready for the final database initialization in the remote shell.
